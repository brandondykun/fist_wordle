# FIST Wordle

FIST Wordle is a side project that was built for my fellow military team members. The game uses only military specific words, and when a word is guessed correctly, the technical definition is displayed. It was designed to be simple, fun and educational.

# What is FIST Wordle?

What is FIST wordle? It's simple! It's just like wordle, but with a theme.

To understand what the theme is, you first have to understand what the word FIST means. FIST is a military acronym that stands for Fire Support Team. Members of a Fire Support Team are called Joint Fire Support Specialists, and we have the best job in the military!

That being said, FIST Wordle is just like regular Wordle except it only uses 5 letter words that are in some way, shape, or form related to the FIST realm. The words are standard English words, but have a totally different meaning in the FIST context. Some notable past words were: BLAST, JOKER, and BINGO.

# Why was it created?

So there I was, at a 2 week field training exercise for the military in northwestern New York state. A friend of mine, who plays wordle religiously, was well...playing wordle. It was at that moment where I had the brilliant idea to create a custom themed wordle that I could use to entertain my friend and the rest of our team. So, after a few days of coding in my down time, I created FIST Wordle and deployed it using GitHub Pages. Over the following days, I made some changes and incorporated a feature to display the technical military definition of the word if the user guesses it correctly. This made it not only fun, but also educational for newer team members!

# Technologies

FIST Wordle uses React and is deployed using GitHub Pages. It does not currently use a backend, and the daily word is updated manually.

# Future

This project was designed to be a small, fun project to practice some tricky logic and sleek UI design. There are no current plans to improve FIST Wordle, but in the future, local storage could be implemented to limit a user to one game per day.
